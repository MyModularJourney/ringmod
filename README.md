# RingMod
The "One Ring" (modulator)

Based on the original shematic by Ken Stone. All rights remain with him. https://sdiy.info/wiki/CGS_active_real_ring_modulator
I created this PCB for personal use. It's shared for educational purposes for those that want to experiment with ring modulation in their Eurorack synthesizer.

I've uploaded the BOM with some links to high quality hardware (pots, knobs, sockets) and the specific transformers I used in my build. Feel free to find your own cheaper/better components. 
I generally use Tayda for passives, Mouser for IC's, Thonk for hardware, and special components wherever they are available. 

Detailed build guide will follow soon. If you're building before that time, just make sure to solder the electrolytic caps on the backside of the boards before installing the sockets and ferrite beads. Other than that the silkscreen should tell you enough.
