# RingMod
The "One Ring" (modulator)

Based on the original shematic by Ken Stone. All rights remain with him. https://sdiy.info/wiki/CGS_active_real_ring_modulator
I created this PCB for personal use. It's shared for educational purposes for those that want to experiment with ring modulation in their Eurorack synthesizer.

BOM + build guide will follow soon
